A simple playlist and batch file to stream TripleJ from within Windows

I've been using this for years but every now and then I end up on a new PC that doesn't have it and I get frustrated that I can't figure out how to easily stream TripleJ without having to use Flash or some other component that I don't necessarily have. 

I typically invoke most of my applications from the command line, so this is set up so you can simply type 'triplej' in any command prompt and it will start streaming. If you eschew typing things to make your computer do stuff, you can simply get the .pls file and double click it. 

## Requirements

- A media player that handles .pls files (I use Winamp).

## Usage

- Put the batch file somewhere in your path.
- Put the playlist somewhere on your system (e.g., My Documents).
- Modify batch file so that it points to location of your playlist.
- Open a command prompt and type 'triplej' and see if it starts streaming.
